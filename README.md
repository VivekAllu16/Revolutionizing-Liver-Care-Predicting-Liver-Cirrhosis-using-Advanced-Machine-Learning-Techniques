# Revolutionizing-Liver-Care-Predicting-Liver-Cirrhosis-using-Advanced-Machine-Learning-Techniques
Liver cirrhosis is a progressive and potentially life-threatening condition that often goes undetected in its early stages. Early prediction can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely medical intervention. This project aims to leverage machine learning to assist in the early detection of liver cirrhosis based on clinical and lifestyle factors.

The solution is built using a trained ML model deployed through a Flask web application, allowing users (e.g., doctors or patients) to input relevant medical data via a web form and receive real-time predictions on whether the indicators suggest liver cirrhosis.

The project combines:

📊 Data Science (for training and evaluation of the model),

💻 Flask Web Framework (for deployment and serving the model),

🌐 HTML/CSS (for the user interface).

It provides a practical and accessible tool for liver cirrhosis screening, showcasing the power of data-driven healthcare applications.
